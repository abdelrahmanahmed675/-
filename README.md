## This is the second project for the Udacity Nanodegree in Front End Developer.
Starter code is included in the project. My app.js file contains a lot of Javascript code, and index.html contains some modifications.



## Exclusive features:

- Navigation is created dynamically in the form of an unordered list.

- When scrolling through the tab, it is obvious which section is being viewed.
page with active state class - When you click a connection in the navigation menu, it scrolls to the appropriate section.
